Members of \nthe GroupLens Research Project are involved in many research projects related \nto the fields of information filtering, collaborative filtering, and \nrecommender systems. The project is lead by professors John Riedl and Joseph \nKonstan. The project began to explore automated collaborative filtering in \n1992, but is most well known for its world wide trial of an automated \ncollaborative filtering system for Usenet news in 1996. Since then the project \nhas expanded its scope to research overall information filtering solutions, \nintegrating in content-based methods as well as improving current collaborative \nfiltering technology.\n\nFurther information on the GroupLens Research project, including research \npublications, can be found at the following web site:\n        \n        http://www.grouplens.org/\n\nGroupLens Research currently operates a movie recommender based on \ncollaborative filtering:\n\n        http://www.movielens.org/\n\nRATINGS FILE DESCRIPTION\n================================================================================\n\nAll ratings are contained in the file \"ratings.dat\" and are in the\nfollowing format:\n\nUserID::MovieID::Rating::Timestamp\n\n- UserIDs range between 1 and 6040 \n- MovieIDs range between 1 and 3952\n- Ratings are made on a 5-star scale (whole-star ratings only)\n- Timestamp is represented in seconds since the epoch as returned by time(2)\n- Each user has at least 20 ratings\n\nUSERS FILE DESCRIPTION\n================================================================================\n\nUser information is in the file \"users.dat\" and is in the following\nformat:\n\nUserID::Gender::Age::Occupation::Zip-code\n\nAll demographic information is provided voluntarily by the users and is\nnot checked for accuracy.
